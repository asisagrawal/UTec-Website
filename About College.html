     <h1>Introduction:</h1>
     <p>
      United Technical College, College of Engineering, popularly known as
      (U-TEC), was established in 2008 (2065 BS) under private sector
      initiative. The foundation of U-TEC was instigated by a group of
      farsighted professionals and academicians who comprehended the need of a
      college for offering the technical education outside the valley. Mostly,
      the university level engineering education in private sector was
      concentrated in the capital only. Therefore, for reaching a wider section
      of Nepali youth outside the valley and making the quality technical
      education accessible and affordable to the poor and deprived youths in
      outer region, it was essential to establish technical colleges outside the
      capital, which U-TEC did by establishing the first private engineering
      college in Chitwan. Since its establishment, the youths from outside the
      valley region have taken full advantage and are continually enrolling in
      different engineering disciplines offered by the college. Since the
      establishment the college has produced six batches of undergraduate
      engineers so far in Civil Engineering and three in Electrical &
      Electronics Engineering.
     </p>
     <p>
      The facility at U-TEC is located in Bharatpur Metropolitan City, Ward
      No.-11, Bhojad, U-TEC Chowk, Chitwan. It has physical and institutional
      resources built on 20 Ropanies (1.0 ha) of land. These resources
      essentially cateres to the academic needs in the bachelor level programs.
      The full-time Bachelor of Civil Engineering, Computer Engineering and
      Electrical & Electronics Engineering degree offered by U-TEC, affiliated
      to Pokhara University, builds skill, expertise, and knowledge among its
      graduates in the area of higher technology and design. The industry driven
      project works, research and development and learning outlined by the
      university is followed strictly to enhance the academic quality. So, UTEC
      provides unconditional opportunities for graduates to pursue engineering
      education with passion and confidence.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition to above, U-TEC has gained opportunity in achieving its centre
      of excellence in education as Pokhara University granted affiliation from,
      March 2018, (i.e. Falgun 2074 BS) for running graduate course leading to
      M.Sc. (Master of Science) degree in Construction Management (CM) at the
      same facility. Presently, third batch of graduate students in CM are
      enrolled and courses are running smoothly.
     </p>
     <p>
      U-TEC is headed by the Executive Chairman, who is responsible for overall
      planning, administration and management and is providing leadership in
